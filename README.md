Project inception: Conceptualized as a game where users can choose a destination and navigate using a virtual vehicle.
Setting: The game is set within the SUST campus, with the vehicle moving based on user commands.
Initial focus: Primarily focused on basic movements – left, right, up, and down – in response to user input.
Symbol representation: The '@' symbol represents the virtual vehicle in the game.
Starting point: The journey starts from the SUST Gate, and a random destination is selected for the user.
User interaction: Movement is controlled using arrow keys on the keyboard to reach the desired destination.
